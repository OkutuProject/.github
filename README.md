## What is Okutu in simple terms?
It is a game platform that provides a unified and accessible experience for players by providing a single client and account for all the games, while ensuring full developer freedom.
Think of it like a game platform equivelant to federated social media.

## Is this a Roblox clone?
No. The goal of this project is to provide a free as in freedom gaming platform for all.

## Is this a Roblox alternative?
Depends, if your goal is to make multiplayer games with easy distribution, unified playerbase and ease of access in an inituitive way, then yes it can be. If your goal is cashgrab slop spam/easy money, then not really.

## How will Okutu achieve this?
Okutu will have a unified client for players where they will make their accounts without the need for a central ID server, while developers will make their multiplayer games normally and talk with the Okutu client via its standard API. Then the players will access your games through Okutu. (we will also provide plugins for common game engines, and full game templates for Godot with ready server, networking and Okutu client API wrapping.)

## Why not a standalone game over Okutu?
Okutu's goal is not to be "the game platform", we are simply another tool/platform with its own benefits. Thanks to its open source nature, nothing stops you from taking your game designed for Okutu and making it a standalone one, or taking your standalone game and adpating it to Okutu, or making your game a standalone game and an Okutu game at the same time.

## What about hosting?
The biggest benefit of existing centralized game platforms is their free hosting in exchange for revenue share model. Okutu will not have this in the core project so the game developers will have to cover the hosting. Okutu aims to streamline this process and make it very easy via its open source tech and templates, and provide every benefit of such platforms that can be done without centralization.
In the future, Okutu may have centralized "sub platforms" that will still use fully open source tech and will still be unified through the Okutu client, providing players and developers features that come with centralized platforms while still keeping it federated. We will always prioritize developer freedom and open source tech.

## Is there an Okutu game engine?
Not for now. Okutu is engine agnostic, so you can develop for Okutu using any engine (existing ones, your own etc.). We will provide templates for existing engines as development continues.
We recommend Godot Engine for Okutu game development due to its open source nature, high versatility and inituitiveness to use. We will provide our game templates via Godot.
