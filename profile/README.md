## Okutu
Okutu is a project whose goal is to provide a free as in freedom game platform for both players and developers. Where players can play games through a unified frontend as a unified playerbase, while developers have full freedom in developing, distributing and hosting their games.

## FAQ
**Q:** Is this a Roblox clone?<br/>
**A:** No. The goal of this project is to provide a free as in freedom gaming platform for all. Due to its design we are unable to provide features such as free hosting.

**Q:** Is this a Roblox alternative?<br/>
**A:** Yes. Okutu started as a project due to the need for a Roblox alternative, one that is not restrictive or constrained while keeping as many benefits from the concept as possible.

**Q:** Why not a standalone game over Okutu?<br/>
**A:** Okutu's goal is not to be "the game platform" or "the go to choice in game development", we are simply another tool/platform with its own benefits. Thanks to its open source nature, nothing stops you from taking your game designed for Okutu and making it a standalone one, taking your standalone game and adpating it to Okutu, or making your game a standalone game and an Okutu game at the same time.

**Q:** What about hosting of multiplayer games?<br/>
**A:** The biggest benefit of existing centralized game platforms is their free hosting in exchange for revenue share model. Okutu will not have this in the core project due to its nature, so the game developers themselves will have to cover the hosting. Okutu aims to streamline this process as much as possible via its open source tech. In the future, Okutu may have centralized "sub platforms" that will still use fully open source tech and will still be unified through the Okutu client, providing players and developers features that come with centralized platforms while still keeping it federated. 

**Q:** Is there an Okutu game engine?<br/>
**A:** Not for now. Okutu is engine agnostic, so you can develop for Okutu using any engine (existing ones, your own etc.). We will provide templates for existing engines as development continues. We recommend Godot Engine for Okutu game development due to its open source nature, high versatility and inituitiveness to use. We plan to provide our game and server templates via Godot.
